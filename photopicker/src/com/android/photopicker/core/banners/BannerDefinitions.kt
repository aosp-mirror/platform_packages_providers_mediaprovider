package com.android.photopicker.core.banners

/**
 * An registry of all supported [Banner]s in Photopicker. Any Banner that must be shown via
 * [BannerManager] needs to first define itself in this class.
 *
 * Banners are essentially defined by three values, the id, if the banner can be dismissed by the
 * user, and the strategy for tracking it's dismissal. Actual banner implementations rely on the
 * [Banner] interface.
 *
 * @property id A unique (to this enum) string id of the banner
 * @property dismissable Whether the banner is dismiss-able by the user
 * @property dismissableStrategy How to track the banner's dismiss state.
 * @see [Banner] for details for actually implementing a banner that can be displayed.
 * @see [BannerDeclaration.DismissStrategy] for details about how dismiss state can be tracked.
